        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>This app is intended for use as a supplemental revision aid in your preparation for the Maths exam. 
            It should be used alongside the practice questions provided in the training notes and in 
            consultation with your Tutor.</p>
            
        <h4>Instructions For Use</h4>
        <p>Choose a button from the left column for the subject you wish to revise. Each click will create 
            a new sum. Once you have completed your answer on paper, click the ‘solution’ button to see a 
            full, worked solution. A counter within the Solution button shows the number of times 
            the solution has been viewed.</p>
            
        <h4>Link To Training Notes</h4>
        <p>Under each question, a link is provided which will take you to the relevant area of the training notes.</p>
            
        <h4>Non-Calculator Maths</h4>
        <p>This button randomly produces one of two different expressions. Each should be solved without 
            using a calculator.</p>
          
        <h4>Algebra: Solve Equation</h4>
        <p>This button randomly produces one of a range of different expressions. Each requires you to find the 
            value of the variable required to balance the equation. You may use your calculator to achieve 
            this but remember to show all the steps of your solution.</p>
          
        <h4>Transposition I & II</h4>
        <p>These buttons randomly produce one of a range of different expressions, to be transposed as indicated.
            Transposition II is at a higher level of difficulty than Tansposition I, matching the 2 levels 
            in the training notes. The solutions show a step-by-step approach, with alternative solutions where
            appropriate.</p>
          
        <h4>Quadratics</h4>
        <p>The quadratic equation produced by this button should be factorised to find the 1 or 2 values 
            that will solve the equation.</p>
            
        <h4>HCF/LCM</h4>
        <p>This button produces an expression containing 3 terms. Without using a calculator, find the HCF 
            and LCM and then use the HCF to factorise the expression.</p>
            
        <h4>Fractions</h4>
        <p>The sum produced by this button contains 3 mixed-number fractions in either an addition and/or 
            subtraction sum or a multiplication and/or division sum. In each case, you are required to 
            find a solution, without using a calculator, giving your answer in its simplest form. The 
            given solution may differ from yours in the results of any cancelling but the final answer 
            should still be the same.</p>
            
        <h4>Simultaneous Equations</h4>
        <p>This button randomly produces one of two different questions. The first is two equations in the 
            form y = ax + b, to be solved using the substitution method. The second is two equations in the 
            form ax + by = c, to be solved using the elimination method. In each case, the solution given 
            will be one of several possible approaches so bear in mind that, while your approach may be different, 
            this does not mean it is wrong. The final values found should of course, be the same.</p>
            
        <h4>Indices</h4>
        <p>The sum produced by this button will be a random selection of radicals (roots) and whole number 
            and fractional indexes. The focus should be on showing each step in the simplification process.</p>
        
        <h4>RA Triangle Trigonometry</h4>
        <p>This button produces a right angled triangle with 2 randomly selected parameters missing. While 
            there is usually more than one way to calculate each parameter, the given solution will always 
            follow the policy of using the information given in the question rather than figures 
            calulated in a previous stage of the solution. Remember to show the correct units in your 
            solution.</p>
            
        <h4>Surface Area & Volume</h4>
        <p>One of four shapes will be displayed, with randomly selected dimensions. In each case, the 
            surface area and volume of the shape is to be calculated. Stage solutions are given to 2 decimal 
            places, allowing the final answer to be rounded to the required 1 decimal place. You may use your 
            Area & Volume equations sheet to assist you.  Remember to show the correct units in your 
            solution.</p>
            
        <h4>Percentages & Ratios</h4>
        <p>Randomly selects 1 of 6 different question types (5 percentage & 1 ratio). 
            In the ratio question, ensure you show the correct units.</p>
            
        <h4>Proportionality</h4>
        <p>Presents a series of problems in proportionality.</p>
            
        <h4>Test Designer</h4>
        <p>Allows you to create a test in a design of your choosing, which can be printed or presented as a pdf. Instructions are given on each page.</p>
